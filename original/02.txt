Very well said I concur and wish to express my heartfelt thanks to Professor Bushee for a thoroughly enjoyable Coursera experience.Thanks Professor,Mike

Great course. Thanks to everyone who made it happen, especially Professor Bushee. Although I found the comic students distracting at the begin, I quickly came to realize the value of this (sort of) interactive format. I could take out a lot of new information and was able to already apply some of it.I'm looking forward to see more material from Wharton on Coursera and will be closely following your MBA program (in real uni).

In video lecture prof. Bushee mentioned current marketable securities and non-current marketable securities. Current marketable securities are securities that mature in less then a year and they would include "short term highly rated government-issued securities" and "government entities in maturities measured in days - 120, 90, 60, 30, or 15 days", wouldn't they?
